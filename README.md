## **Implementation Details**

**Thesaurus Rex** was built with modern web technologies to ensure speed, reliability, and a smooth user experience:

### **Technologies Used**

- **React**: The popup interface and modal window are built with React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and quick hot-reloading during the development process, I used Vite to bundle and optimize the code.
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: The extension leverages various Chrome APIs to store user data (bookmarks) locally and interact with the browser.
- **Word API Integration**: I integrated a powerful external API to fetch word definitions, phonetics, and synonyms. This API enables the extension to pull real-time word data and display it instantly when a user queries a word.
- **CSS Transitions**: To enhance the UI, smooth transitions and animations are applied when the user interacts with the popup, making for a polished, seamless experience.

### **React & Popup Modal**

The extension’s popup modal is built with **React** to dynamically display the word definitions and manage the user interface:

- **React State Management**: React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` manage the app’s state, including user settings and bookmarks.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The extension intelligently switches between different screens (Settings and Bookmarks) using conditional rendering.
- **CSSTransition**: React Transition Group is used for smooth transitions and animations when adding or removing bookmarks.

### **Bookmarks**

- **Chrome Storage API**: Bookmarks are stored locally using the `chrome.storage.local` API. This allows bookmarks to persist between sessions without needing an external database.
- **Bookmark UI**: Bookmarks are displayed in the modal and can be removed easily by clicking the 'X' button next to each word.
  
### **API for Word Data**

The extension fetches word definitions, synonyms, and phonetic data from a reliable word API. The response from the API is parsed and displayed within the popup in an organized manner. Here’s a brief breakdown of how the API is used:

1. **Word Lookup**: The word selected by the user is sent to the API, which returns a JSON response containing:
   - Definition(s)
   - Part of speech (noun, verb, etc.)
   - Phonetic pronunciation (IPA or audio)
   - Synonyms
   
2. **Error Handling**: In case the API doesn’t return a result (e.g., for rare or slang words), a fallback message is displayed, notifying the user that no information could be retrieved.

### **Popup UI**

The popup UI is designed to be minimalistic yet informative, showing:
- The word and its definition(s).
- Phonetic transcription and audio (if available).
- A list of synonyms to help the user broaden their vocabulary.
  
### **Customization Options**

In the **Settings** screen of the extension, users can toggle:
- **Display Button**: Show or hide the quick-access button that appears when the user highlights a word.
- **Play Sound on Definition**: Toggle an audio cue that plays whenever a word’s definition is displayed, enhancing the experience.

## **Future Updates**

- **Synonym Suggestions**: Plan to implement more advanced synonym filtering based on context.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Further improvements to make the extension even more intuitive, such as adding a history feature to revisit past lookups.
- **Expanded Word Database**: Integrating additional word sources for more comprehensive definitions and examples.
